# C-Programing-Basics-DSA-101
Documentation and code mangement is something fundamental, learning to write C code.

I will try my best to nest Directories/Folders properly.
I will be maintaining only Directories/Folders for: 
source code 

to convert it to executable use the following command after you have a gcc compiler installed
gcc source.c -o ./exe

ZERO TRUST
I hope you read the source code EVERYTIME BEFORE you execute the excutable file. 


UPDATING SOON
There is an GUI/web based documentation to help you understand my approch, just in case as i used a technology containerization.
